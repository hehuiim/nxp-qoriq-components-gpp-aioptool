AIOP Tool (aiop_tool) is a userspace application for performing operations
on an AIOP Tile using MC interfaces. This application enables the user to
fetch status of tile, load a valid ELF file and run it on a tile and get and set
time of day.

Pre-requisite:
-------------
1. This requires a non-root container containing atleast a dpmcp and dpaiop
   object. This container can be statically defined (Static DPL) or dynamically
   created (using restool). This is NOT the container which is reserved by
   MC for interaction with AIOP.
   There is a sample DPL file in samples folder.

2. VFIO support in Linux Kernel
   This application assumes that the dpaiop device would be mapped into VFIO
   driver so as to use is feature of DMA Mapping and pushing SMMU addresses
   for AIOP's access to use space memory
   A sample script has been placed in samples folder which shows how to bind
   the container (containing dpaiop device) to VFIO - assuming support for
   vfio-fsl-mc driver in inbuilt.

3. Valid AIOP Image for loading

Build:
-----

1. Export KERNEL_PATH environment variable.
   VFIO search for uapi/linux/vfio.h file.

2. Update the CROSS_COMPILER with appropriate path to toolchain binaries.
   Update CFLAGS if required, for example, for adding debug info

3. $ make clean
   $ make
   OR,
   $ make install # would perform make and put binary in BINDIR

4. 'aiop_tool' binary would be available in bin folder.

5. $ make install DESTDIR=<Path>
   to place the binary in <Path>/usr/bin

Run:
----

1. $ aiop_tool -h
2. Example command for loading AIOP Image:
   $ aiop_tool load -g <container name> -f <path to file> -d -v

   '-g' is option and can be set through environment variable DPRC. If not
   provided on command line or not set through DPRC, default dprc.5 is assumed.

   '-d' and '-v' are for debugging and verbose information, respectively. These
   are optional.
3. Example command for getting status of AIOP Tile:
   $ aiop_tool status
4. Example command for getting time on AIOP Tile:
   $ aiop_tool gettod
5. Example command for setting time on AIOP Tile:
   $ aiop_tool settod -g dprc.2 -t <Time in Seconds since Epoch>
